# MK-TAN: The System That Hates You Back

---

### 01. Introduction

Welcome to MK-TAN ‚Äî a project born from boredom, curiosity, and a complete absence of dopamine.
If you're DARPA, CIA, FBI, NSA, or any other three-letter acronym:
Yes, I'm doing what probably took your agencies millions, NDAs, and decades‚Ä¶ but solo with no degree, no team, no clearance, and no funding.
Just persistence, a grayscale UX, a soft-bricked laptop, and a dopamine-resistant Android setup. Also: I'm a minor.

Because why not? I‚Äôm bored either way.
Because boredom isn‚Äôt the enemy. Stagnation is.

### 02. What is MK-TAN?

MK-TAN is a series of projects designed for one purpose: to confuse and/or annoy almost every "normal," mentally average person.
MK-TAN aims to explore perception as an attack surface, turning things like ambient sound into computational intent.

My current focus is on a topic I accidentally stumbled across:
MK-TAN_OmegaS is a modular experimental framework for exploring perceptual and cognitive response patterns through precision sound, modulation, and signal disruption.

It runs on scavenged hardware so primitive, your government‚Äôs black-budget procurement officers would file a threat report before booting it.

The CLI (no GUI for now) is not designed for dopamine. It‚Äôs designed to disrupt cognitive norms and explore new vectors in perception. Oh, and for usability.
"WHO TURNED ANIMATIONS OFF !!11!1!11!!1337" ‚Äî IARPA

Think of it as a psychoacoustic sandbox built with Python, maybe a little C++ in the future, and 100% stubbornness.

### 03. Why Should You Care?

* Because psychology is an attack surface.
* Because perceptual security is still ten years behind.
* Because YOU yourself are always vulnerable.

Why do I do this?
Because you don‚Äôt need a black budget ‚Äî just focus and time.
Because I can.
Because curiosity doesn‚Äôt need permission.
Because I`m bored.


I built MK-TAN on:

* A Win10 RDP box with enough security holes to qualify as a cheese grater,
* A Chromebook that‚Äôs somehow fine,
* A soft-bricked laptop that swaps Explorer with CMD,
* And an Android phone that rejects normalcy harder than DARPA might reject me after I tell them I can‚Äôt sign NDAs.

Total budget: $0. Total care for comfort: also $0.

### 04. Ethics & Legal Positioning

I'm a minor (<18), and I operate on the **correct side** (legal, ethical, and safe) of the law.
All work is theoretical, simulated, and conducted within U.S. legal, ethical, and bioethical guidelines.

> No human testing.
> No bio-weapons.
> No black-hat "deployments."
> No real-world payload distribution.

This is **not** a medical tool. Not a defense system (unless DARPA or CIA‚Äôs TAO asks for it. Or *maybe* any other non-us agency bold enough to ask.)
Not a product.
It‚Äôs academic. It‚Äôs experimental. It‚Äôs personal.

‚ö†Ô∏è **DO NOT** generate or run audio payloads from any repo ‚Äî including any of mine ‚Äî AT ALL. EVER. (your brain will probably melt into slime)
Only test in **controlled** and **non-live** DIGITAL environments.

Just because I use grayscale interfaces and Dvorak doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm broken.
It means I build for clarity ‚Äî not comfort.

### 05. Hardware Setup

* Win10 RDP box with enough security holes to qualify as a cheese grater
* Chromebook in full grayscale (no distractions, just decisions)
* Android phone with no dopamine, no normal UI, and all the settings nobody touches except for me
* Raspberry Pi 5 waiting on a $12 SSD adapter to be resurrected

### 07. Final Words

> ‚ÄúIf it took them $47 million, it took me 47 hours.‚Äù

MK-TAN exists to push boundaries, invert expectations, and weaponize boredom into innovation.
It‚Äôs not here to make you feel safe. It‚Äôs here to make you think differently ‚Äî maybe even sweat.

If this reads like a challenge ‚Äî good.
MK-TAN isn‚Äôt waiting to be discovered. It‚Äôs waiting to be understood.
